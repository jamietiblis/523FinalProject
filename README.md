# Database Concepts and Applications Final Project
The purpose of this project was to develop a relational database for an interior design company, which was broken down into 3 separate phases.

### Phase 1 - Database Design
The database design phase of the project involved the construction of an entity-relationship model, schema, and data dictionary by leveraging the provided information pertaining to the interior design company in alignment with the project's specifications.

### Phase 2 - Database Development
The database development phase of this project involved a comprehensive schema-to-SQL transformation process with schema parsing and data mapping to initialize the foundational structure of the database architecture.

Following the creation of SQL tables and associated attributes, data records were incorporated into the database, encompassing client information, designer details, job specifications, inspection data, various categories of work executed by contractors, contractor-specific particulars, and task entries.

### Phase 3 - Testing the Database
Following this, the database underwent rigorous testing through the execution of structured queries to validate its compliance with anticipated functionality.

### Opening the Database:
To access the database, download the .db file from this repository and open it with your preferred database management software.
